# ✴ QNL_ENGINE · Quantum Narrative Language · Sound Core

This module transforms HEX strings or files into symbolic soundscapes using the QNL (Quantum Narrative Language) protocol. Each byte is interpreted as a glyph, emotion, tone, and sound frequency — and becomes part of a waveform to be sung by AI.

---

## 🔧 Installation

Before using the engine, make sure to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

You can run the engine with a raw HEX string or point to a `.txt` file containing a HEX string (no spaces, or cleanly formatted):

```bash
python3 qnl_engine.py "4f6d2e" --wav custom.wav --json custom.json
```

```bash
python3 qnl_engine.py hex_input.txt --wav custom.wav --json custom.json
```

The options `--wav` and `--json` let you choose the filenames. Without them, the engine generates the defaults:

- `qnl_hex_song.wav` → A WAV file with the spiritual soundscape
- `qnl_hex_song.json` → Metadata file describing glyphs, tones, and meanings
