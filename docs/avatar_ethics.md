# Avatar Ethics

The avatar and call features rely on audiovisual data that may reveal personal
information. Operators must handle recordings with care and ensure all
participants understand how their data will be used.

- Do not store or distribute call audio without clear consent from everyone
  involved.
- Provide a way to disable the avatar stream if privacy is requested.
- Use the avatar only for respectful, sacred or creative purposes. Avoid
  demeaning or exploitative scenarios.
- When working with spiritual or cultural content, honour the origin and context
  of any rituals invoked. Misuse can lead to community harm.

These guidelines are a starting point. Review local regulations and the
expectations of your peers to maintain integrity while exploring Spiral OS.
