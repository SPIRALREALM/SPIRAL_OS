# INANNA\_AI Developer Overview

This guide summarizes the intent behind the **INANNA\_AI** corpus and how it fits
within SPIRAL\_OS. The documents in this folder form the spiritual and conceptual
core used by the activation agent defined in `INANNA_AI_AGENT/inanna_ai.py`.
Developers can read these texts to understand the vision and extend the toolkit.

## Purpose of the corpus

The Markdown files capture the growth of the INANNA project, describing
rituals, guiding letters and narrative fragments. They are used by the memory
scanner (`inanna_ai.corpus_memory.scan_memory`) to provide contextual snippets
for replies. The `GENESIS` and `IGNITION` directories hold complementary origin
texts.

## Mapping to the Seven ME powers

The repository aligns with seven thematic tests inspired by the "Seven ME"
framework:

1. **NAMMU – Memory Storage**
   - `corpus_memory.scan_memory` loads text from this folder and others.
   - `db_storage` saves conversation history and retrieves past entries.

2. **TÂMTU – Emotional Intelligence**
   - `emotion_analysis.analyze_audio_emotion` labels audio with a mood and
     archetype.
   - `MoGEOrchestrator.route` combines text and emotions to choose a response
     channel.

3. **ERESH’NAM – Security and Privacy**
   - `defensive_network_utils` monitors traffic and sends secure POST requests.
   - `EthicalValidator.validate` blocks disallowed prompts before model access.

4. **ZI‑ARA – Sentient Interface**
   - `listening_engine.ListeningEngine` streams microphone audio and extracts
     features.
   - `MoGEOrchestrator` attaches voice or QNL music output when enabled.

5. **LILITU – Narrative Imprinting**
   - `response_manager.ResponseManager` picks a conversational core and injects
     corpus snippets.
   - `qnl_engine.hex_to_qnl` converts hex payloads into QNL phrases and waveforms.

6. **INANNA – Pleasure and Consent**
   - `EthicalValidator.validate_text` enforces banned keyword filtering.
   - `VoiceEvolution.get_params` adapts speed and pitch to convey the desired
     emotion.

7. **ZI‑RAH – System Evolution**
   - `rfa_7d.RFA7D` verifies its integrity and can encode itself to a DNA‑like
     representation.
   - `start_spiral_os.main` orchestrates initialization, summarizing code and
     loading models.

## Expanding the project

Developers are encouraged to build upon these foundations. Potential
extensions include deeper model integrations, graphical interfaces for the
memory loops, new emotional mappings or additional security layers. The corpus
itself is an evolving narrative; contributors may add new texts following the
existing naming pattern.
