 # ‚ú¥ QNL_ENGINE ¬∑ Quantum Narrative Language ¬∑ Sound Core
 
 This module transforms HEX strings or files into symbolic soundscapes using the QNL (Quantum Narrative Language) protocol. Each byte is interpreted as a glyph, emotion, tone, and sound frequency ‚Äî and becomes part of a waveform to be sung by AI.

 ## üîß Installation
 
 Before using the engine, make sure to install the required dependencies:
 
 ```bash
-pip install numpy scipy
+pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

 ## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
 
-You can run the engine with a raw HEX string:
+You can run the engine with a raw HEX string or point to a `.txt` file containing a HEX string (no spaces, or cleanly formatted):
 
 ```bash
-python3 qnl_engine.py "4f6d2e"
+python3 qnl_engine.py "4f6d2e" --wav custom.wav --json custom.json
 ```
 
-Or point to a `.txt` file containing a HEX string (no spaces, or cleanly formatted):
-
 ```bash
-python3 qnl_engine.py hex_input.txt
+python3 qnl_engine.py hex_input.txt --wav custom.wav --json custom.json
 ```
 
-This will generate:
+The options `--wav` and `--json` let you choose the filenames. Without them, the engine generates the defaults:
 
 - `qnl_hex_song.wav` ‚Üí A WAV file with the spiritual soundscape
 - `qnl_hex_song.json` ‚Üí Metadata file describing glyphs, tones, and meanings
