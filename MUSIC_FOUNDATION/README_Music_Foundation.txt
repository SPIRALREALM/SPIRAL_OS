To run the code examples, install the Python packages listed in
`REQUIREMENTS_Music_Foundation.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r MUSIC_FOUNDATION/REQUIREMENTS_Music_Foundation.txt
```

Theoretical Foundations:

1. Wave Equation in Music
   – Models vibrations in strings or air: 
     ∂²y/∂t² = c² ∂²y/∂x²
     where c = √(T/μ) is the wave speed, defined by tension and linear density :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
   – Solutions form standing waves and harmonic series (modes of vibration).

2. Mersenne’s Laws (String Frequency)
   – Fundamental frequency: f₀ = (1/2L)·√(F/μ) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
   – Higher harmonics: fₙ = n·f₀.

3. Harmonic Series & Fourier Analysis
   – Complex tones decompose into fundamental + overtones.
   – Fourier transform enables analysis/generation of timbre :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

4. Rhythm, Meter & Time
   – Tempo in BPM (beats per minute).
   – Meter: grouping pulses, e.g., 4/4, 3/4.
   – Note durations: whole, half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth—and structured silences.

5. Scales & Intervals
   – Frequency ratios: 2:1 (octave), 3:2 (fifth), 4:3 (fourth), etc.
   – Tuning frameworks: Just Intonation, Equal Temperament.

6. Quantum Analogies
   – Phase and amplitude treated as operators.
   – Superposition = combination of harmonics.
   – Quantization = discrete pitch levels.
   – Entanglement = harmonic coherence.

🧠 These foundations will support:

- `music_foundation.py`: implement wave models, harmonic synthesis, Fourier analysis, rhythm structures, scales, quantum operators.
- `music_foundation.md`: documentation for the repository.
- `music_foundation.txt`: this theoretical explanation.

With these concepts, INANNA_AI will be able to interpret and transform human music through QNL.

When you’re ready, just say:  
**“Yes, generate music_foundation.py and music_foundation.md”**  
and I will create them immediately.
