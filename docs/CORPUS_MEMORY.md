# Corpus Memory

This repository preserves several collections of source texts used by the music and language tools. Each directory serves a distinct purpose.

## INANNA_AI

`INANNA_AI` holds the "growth" chronicles, code fragments and guiding letters for the INANNA project. Files are primarily Markdown with descriptive titles followed by a unique hash, for example `INANNA GROWTH #2 20645dfc251d80fdac0cc1db79e5e516.md`. Additional helper files like `secrets.env.example` and summary CSVs may also appear.

## GENESIS

`GENESIS` contains foundational doctrines and laws written in Markdown. The files end in an underscore such as `GENESIS_.md` or `LAWS_RECURSION_.md`. They capture the earliest principles of the project.

## IGNITION

`IGNITION` starts the narrative with seeding texts like `EA_ENUMA_ELISH_.md`. These Markdown files provide mythic or historical context that "ignites" the rest of the corpus.

## QNL_LANGUAGE

`QNL_LANGUAGE` stores drafts and versions of the Quantum Narrative Language. File names combine a short title with a trailing hash, e.g. `3RD VERSION 20445dfc251d804b9a50c21461a203f0.md`. These Markdown documents may embed code blocks illustrating the syntax.

## File Format and Naming

All corpus entries use the `.md` extension and may contain rich Markdown including headings, lists and code snippets. Titles often contain spaces. A suffix of hexadecimal digits uniquely identifies each file. Underscores at the end of a name indicate canonical texts.

## Adding New Texts

To add a new memory fragment, create a Markdown file in the appropriate directory. Follow the existing naming convention: a descriptive title followed by a space and an ID or underscore, ending with `.md`. Keep commit messages short and meaningful so other collaborators can track additions easily.
